__Databridge__
- Awsome database as a service platform

- More security ? go with cidr like ip access rules

__Gitroaster__
> Spending to much time on code review ? hand it down to our roaster -> gitroaster.space
- It provides in memory code review
- No code is stored in our database
- Simple 3 to 4 clicks and boom it's up
- Completly autonomous
